	 <a id="Teum"><h3>Teum</h3></a>
	 <time datetime="2019-06-15">2019.06.15 </time>
	 <p><br>I was raised by my father who is Korean based on traditional drawing.
As times changed, I felt a shame for the loss of traditional drawing with beautiful techniques due to various situations, so I decided to use my major to create a new media art that mix modern technology with past paintings. And the first project was Teum.

</p>
	 <!-- <p>Teum is a digital artwork that change by the sound interaction of an audience's hand along a landscape painting painted on a transparent hologram pvc fabric. -->
<!-- I've been thinking a lot about getting out of the stereotype that Korean drawing was old. So I tried to make a way of ink washing painting by making a layering of Western painting techniques using materials that were not used only for indian ink. In the process, we tried to create a gap(In Korean, it is called “Teum”) by opening up a 2D picture and allowing the space to accommodate the current audience time.<br></p> -->

<p><strong> Intention: </strong><br></p>
<p>I would break through a recognition people have what is Korean drawing is outdated by using modern technologies and  vibes, Korea’s new form digital art is my goal. <br></p>

<p><strong> objective: </strong><br></p>
As I put forward and draft unusual Korean Drawing onto various technologies, people will evoke an interest about Korean Drawing. In doing so, I want to inherit the unique style of painting that Korean painting has.<br></p>

<p><strong> The traits of the art</strong><br></p>
It’s a sound interactive installation. Visters can fill out the gap with sound when they touch the surface of the drawing’s ink stain. It’s a sound-interactive installation. Visitors can fill out the Teum(which means gap) with sound when they touch the surface of the drawing’s ink stain.

There are several reasons why Korean traditional drawing has become unpopular.
A hasty change of policy and the trend of the art movement, an influx of Western culture...
Of these, the only one I can is to change trend.

Korean drawings has always been appreciated only when people seen far.
As you know, the existing viewing method, which was only seen from afar, has widened the Psychological distance between the visitors and traditional Korean paintings in the modern world, where new art.

I was experiment with many different types of viewing method to find the best for visitors.
Not to interfere with the beauty of the painting, I felt the need to stimulate hearing.
At the same time, I wanted to add something that the visitors would find fun.
That's why it was created with Sound-interactive installation.

In order to reduce gap(Psychological distance) between modern-people and traditional Korean paintings, I made this work to appreciate truly only when one felt the brush with owns fingertips.<br></p>





   <p>At the Artec rehearsal, we created an interface that was a process-reconstructed landscape painting.
As you move your hands along the interface, the images are played according to the sensitivity and the pitch of the song is configured to change.<div class="banner"><img src="./original.jpeg" width="800px" alt="original"><div class="banner"><img src="./line.png" width="800px" alt="line"></div><div class="banner"><img src="./pixcel.png" width="800px" alt="pixcel">
	<img src="./max.png" width="800px" alt="final">
	<p>The reason why I used the modeling video is that when modern people touch on modern technology reconstructed paintings, considering that Korean landscape ink drawing can no longer show the landscape of Korea, they wanted the modern city to be mapped between the paintings of the past. In other words, with the participation of the audience, we tried to melt the modern landscape into the past. But I want to focus more on the paintings, so I will remove the video and focus on the changes in sound and lighting during the Namsan exhibition.

			<time datetime="2018-01-31">2018.01.31 </time>
      <p>When I was interning at LaMama E.T.C, New York City, Billy, my boss, made me think of the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) anew - the DMZ as an impossibility between you and me. It's not just a cease fire line. <br>So We performed various special projects about Korea’s political agenda, the DMZ.

For my part, I made a media performance with my friends, Anna & Namhae.

<br>I wanted to make something meaningful metaphor storyboard.

This is my storyboard.
<iframe style="display:block; width:50vw; height: 100vh"
		src="./lightbulb-blossom(storyboard).pdf">
</iframe>

Our first idea was to see the DMZ as an impossible line to cross.
So we considered the screen as an impossible zone to cross between people.
I wanted to use a light bulb to signify hope.
Light bulbs need a filament. Thus I used a person, the main character as filament.
The main character, who doesn't know what's inside the screen, is curious about the sound coming from the screen which says, “Can you hear me?”

But when, out of curiosity, she goes behind the screen, she get trapped in the bulb. She feels that the surface of the light bulb is an impossible zone to cross -  DMZ.

Finally, she realizes that the DMZ is in her mind and decides to shine the light to the world through herself rather than to escape from the bulb.

<br>So she accepted the situation and solved the problem through the light.

That’s the story about “Blossom”.
It’s a play so I can’t show you everything.
